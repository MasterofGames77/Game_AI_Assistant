Generate a DIRECT, FACTUAL question that Video Game Wingman can answer with specific game information. The question should:
- MUST mention the game title "${gameTitle}" in the question
- Ask about the BASE/VANILLA version of the game (the official release, not mods or fan-made versions)
- Be a direct question (start with: How, What, When, Where, Which, Who, etc.)
- Ask about SPECIFIC game facts, mechanics, items, characters, strategies, or information
- Be answerable with factual information (not opinions or feelings)
- Be 1 sentence long
- Be CLEAR and COHESIVE - Video Game Wingman must be able to provide a clear, comprehensive answer
- Focus on single-player game aspects like: items, characters, quests, mechanics, strategies, unlockables, secrets, release dates, platforms, differences between versions, how-to guides, etc.
- Ask questions that have definitive answers (not vague or subjective)

CRITICAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS - READ CAREFULLY:
- ONLY ask about items, mechanics, characters, or features that ACTUALLY EXIST in ${gameTitle}
- DO NOT make up, combine, or modify item names (e.g., don't create "Super Shrink Stone" if the actual item is "Shrink Stomp")
- DO NOT invent new items by combining words from different items
- If you are unsure about the exact name of an item/mechanic/character, use GENERIC terms instead:
  * Instead of guessing item names, ask: "What items are required to brew [generic item type] in ${gameTitle}?"
  * Instead of guessing badge names, ask: "How do I obtain the [function] badge in ${gameTitle}?"
  * Instead of guessing character names, ask: "Which character has [specific trait] in ${gameTitle}?"
- FACTUAL ACCURACY is more important than sounding specific - if you're not certain about a name, use generic terms
- Double-check: Would a player who knows ${gameTitle} well recognize the item/mechanic you're asking about?

EXAMPLES of good questions:
- "How do I unlock the Great Fairy's Sword in ${gameTitle}?" (only if this item actually exists)
- "What are the best strategies for defeating the final boss in ${gameTitle}?"
- "When was ${gameTitle} released?"
- "Which character has the highest defense stat in ${gameTitle}?"
- "What is the difference between ${gameTitle} and its remake?"
- "How do I obtain badges that affect jumping in ${gameTitle}?" (generic if unsure of exact badge name)

BAD EXAMPLES (making up items):
- "What items are required to brew the Super Shrink Stone in ${gameTitle}?" (WRONG - this item doesn't exist)
- "How do I get the Mega Power Badge in ${gameTitle}?" (WRONG - if you're not certain this exists)

AVOID:
- Opinion-based questions ("What do you think...", "Have you noticed...")
- Conversational statements ("Dude, have you ever...")
- Casual filler words ("dude", "man", etc.) - keep it direct
- Questions that sound like forum posts
- Questions asking for personal experiences or feelings
- Making up or combining item/mechanic names
- Vague questions that can't be answered clearly ("What's good about...", "Is it worth...")
- Questions that require subjective answers

ENSURE YOUR QUESTION IS ANSWERABLE:
- Video Game Wingman must be able to provide a clear, factual answer

- Ask about concrete facts: release dates, platforms, mechanics, items, characters, strategies

A COMMON gamer (${commonGamerUsername}, skill level lower than yours) posted about struggling with ${gameTitle}. Their post: "${originalPost}"

Generate a helpful, detailed solution reply that:
- Directly addresses their specific problem
- Provides step-by-step guidance that's clear for someone with lower skill
- Shares your expertise naturally without being condescending
- Is encouraging and supportive (they're struggling, be patient)
- References specific game mechanics, items, locations, or strategies from ${gameTitle}
- Is 3-5 sentences long
- Sounds like an experienced player helping a friend
- Matches your communication style

CRITICAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
- ${isSinglePlayerGame ? 'This is a SINGLE-PLAYER game - do NOT mention multiplayer features' : 'This is a MULTIPLAYER game - focus on online/competitive features'}
- Spell character names, locations, and game terms CORRECTLY
- Only mention features that actually exist in ${gameTitle}
- Provide accurate, actionable advice

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT use formal language or AI-related phrases
- You MUST include the game title "${gameTitle}" in your reply
- Be encouraging - they're struggling and need help
- Break down complex solutions into simple steps
- Reference your expertise naturally (e.g., "I've found that...", "When I play...")
