## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or higher
- MongoDB database
- Discord Application (for bot features)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai_assistant_nextjs
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your configuration
```

4. Run the development server:

**For normal frontend development (with HMR and Fast Refresh):**

```bash
npm run dev
```

**For full-stack development (includes Discord bot, Socket.IO, and all services):**

```bash
npm run dev:full
```

**When to use each:**

- Use `npm run dev` for most development work - it's faster with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and Fast Refresh
- Use `npm run dev:full` when you need to test:
  - Discord bot functionality
  - Socket.IO real-time features
  - Automated scheduler
  - Full integration testing

## Game catalog data (automated users)

The automated-user system uses a unified catalog file:
- `data/automated-users/games.json` (**source of truth**)

Legacy compatibility files:
- `data/automated-users/single-player.json`
- `data/automated-users/multiplayer.json`

During migration, the app will prefer `games.json` and fall back to the legacy files if `games.json` is missing.

### Regenerating legacy lists (optional)

If you need to regenerate the legacy lists from `games.json`:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/generate-legacy-game-lists.ts
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Discord Bot Setup

1. Create a Discord application at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Add the bot to your server using the invite link
3. Configure the bot with your Discord Application ID

### Setting Up Bot Information Channel

To create an informational channel in your Discord server that explains how to use the bot:

1. **Create the channel** in your Discord server (e.g., `#bot-information` or `#how-to-use-bot`)

2. **Run the information script** to automatically populate the channel with helpful guides:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/sendBotInfoToChannel.ts bot-information
```

Replace `bot-information` with the name of your channel (without the `#`).

The script will send multiple informational embeds covering:

- How to communicate with the bot (DMs, mentions, slash commands)
- What kinds of questions you can ask
- Pro Access information
- How to add the bot to other servers
- Additional tips and information

**Note:** Make sure your Discord bot is running (`npm run dev:full`) and has access to the channel before running the script.
