To unlock Funky Kong, you need to achieve one of the following goals:\n\n1. **Win 25 different 50cc Cups**: This means you must win first place in 25 individual cups in the 50cc class, but these cups can be any mix of the available competitions in that class.\n\n2. **Unlock 4 Expert Staff Ghosts in Time Trials**: This method entails beating the Expert Staff Ghosts in Time Trials on four different courses. Expert Staff Ghosts are unlocked by beating the Normal Staff Ghosts' times by a significant margin, usually several seconds. These times are set by the developers and can pose a significant challenge to new players.\n\nEither method will unlock Funky Kong for use across all game modes in Mario Kart Wii.","timestamp":"2025-04-06T17:07:34.085Z","userId":"test-0tpl80ofp"}],"userDoc":{"__v":0,"_id":"67b8d7eb60a9b6681114f29e","achievements":[],"conversationCount":9,"email":"test@example.com","hasProAccess":false,"progress":{"actionAficionado":0,"adventureAddict":0,"battleRoyale":0,"bossBuster":0,"collectorPro":0,"conversationalist":0,"dailyExplorer":0,"dataDiver":0,"fightingFanatic":0,"firstQuestion":0,"frequentAsker":0,"horrorHero":0,"performanceTweaker":0,"platformerPro":2,"puzzlePro":0,"racingExpert":0,"rpgEnthusiast":0,"shooterSpecialist":0,"simulationSpecialist":0,"speedrunner":0,"sportsChampion":0,"stealthSpecialist":0,"storySeeker":0,"strategySpecialist":0,"survivalSpecialist":0,"totalQuestions":2,"triviaMaster":0},"userId":"test-0tpl80ofp"}}},"dbConnection":1.2799999999988358,"finalMemory":{"external":"212.4MB","heapTotal":"276.4MB","heapUsed":"239.64MB","rss":"467.5MB"},"initialMemory":{"external":"305.56MB","heapTotal":"236.88MB","heapUsed":"215.98MB","rss":"416.12MB"},"questionProcessing":14363.777699999991,"requestRate":{"requestsPerSecond":"0.07","totalRequests":1},"responseSize":{"bytes":2958,"kilobytes":"2.89KB"},"totalTime":14712.936100000006},"questionLength":43,"service":"game-assistant","userId":"test-0tpl80ofp"}
