To unlock Funky Kong, you need to achieve one of the following goals:\n\n1. **Win 25 different 50cc Cups**: This means you must win first place in 25 individual cups in the 50cc class, but these cups can be any mix of the available competitions in that class.\n\n2. **Unlock 4 Expert Staff Ghosts in Time Trials**: This method entails beating the Expert Staff Ghosts in Time Trials on four different courses. Expert Staff Ghosts are unlocked by beating the Normal Staff Ghosts' times by a significant margin, usually several seconds. These times are set by the developers and can pose a significant challenge to new players.\n\nEither method will unlock Funky Kong for use across all game modes in Mario Kart Wii.","timestamp":"2025-04-06T17:07:34.085Z","userId":"test-0tpl80ofp"}],"userDoc":{"__v":0,"_id":"67b8d7eb60a9b6681114f29e","achievements":[],"conversationCount":9,"email":"test@example.com","hasProAccess":false,"progress":{"actionAficionado":0,"adventureAddict":0,"battleRoyale":0,"bossBuster":0,"collectorPro":0,"conversationalist":0,"dailyExplorer":0,"dataDiver":0,"fightingFanatic":0,"firstQuestion":0,"frequentAsker":0,"horrorHero":0,"performanceTweaker":0,"platformerPro":2,"puzzlePro":0,"racingExpert":0,"rpgEnthusiast":0,"shooterSpecialist":0,"simulationSpecialist":0,"speedrunner":0,"sportsChampion":0,"stealthSpecialist":0,"storySeeker":0,"strategySpecialist":0,"survivalSpecialist":0,"totalQuestions":2,"triviaMaster":0},"userId":"test-0tpl80ofp"}}},"dbConnection":1.2799999999988358,"finalMemory":{"external":"212.4MB","heapTotal":"276.4MB","heapUsed":"239.64MB","rss":"467.5MB"},"initialMemory":{"external":"305.56MB","heapTotal":"236.88MB","heapUsed":"215.98MB","rss":"416.12MB"},"questionProcessing":14363.777699999991,"requestRate":{"requestsPerSecond":"0.07","totalRequests":1},"responseSize":{"bytes":2958,"kilobytes":"2.89KB"},"totalTime":14712.936100000006},"questionLength":43,"service":"game-assistant","userId":"test-0tpl80ofp"}

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to unlocking him:\n\n1. **Unlock Mirror Mode:** First, you need to unlock Mirror Mode. This is done by winning all the cups (Mushroom, Flower, Star, and Special) at 150cc difficulty.\n\n2. **Compete in Mirror Mode:** Once Mirror Mode is unlocked, you need to complete the Special Cup in this mode. The tracks in Mirror Mode are more challenging because they are mirrored versions (left-to-right flipped) of the normal tracks.\n\n3. **Win the Special Cup:** You must finish in first place in the Special Cup on Mirror Mode. This will require mastery of the tracks and good use of items and racing strategies.\n\n4. **Unlock Petey Piranha and King Boo:** Successfully winning the Special Cup on Mirror Mode will unlock both Petey Piranha and King Boo as playable characters. They share a kart, the Piranha Pipes.\n\nAs you race, remember that Mirror Mode can be disorienting at first since all the tracks are reversed, so it might take some time to get used to the changes.
