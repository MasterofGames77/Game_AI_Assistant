Here’s a step-by-step guide to unlocking him:\n\n1. **Unlock Mirror Mode:** First, you need to unlock Mirror Mode. This is done by winning all the cups (Mushroom, Flower, Star, and Special) at 150cc difficulty.\n\n2. **Compete in Mirror Mode:** Once Mirror Mode is unlocked, you need to complete the Special Cup in this mode. The tracks in Mirror Mode are more challenging because they are mirrored versions (left-to-right flipped) of the normal tracks.\n\n3. **Win the Special Cup:** You must finish in first place in the Special Cup on Mirror Mode. This will require mastery of the tracks and good use of items and racing strategies.\n\n4. **Unlock Petey Piranha and King Boo:** Successfully winning the Special Cup on Mirror Mode will unlock both Petey Piranha and King Boo as playable characters. They share a kart, the Piranha Pipes.\n\nAs you race, remember that Mirror Mode can be disorienting at first since all the tracks are reversed, so it might take some time to get used to the changes.
