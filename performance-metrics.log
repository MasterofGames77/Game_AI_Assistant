The tracks in Mirror Mode are more challenging because they are mirrored versions (left-to-right flipped) of the normal tracks.\n\n3. **Win the Special Cup:** You must finish in first place in the Special Cup on Mirror Mode. This will require mastery of the tracks and good use of items and racing strategies.\n\n4. **Unlock Petey Piranha and King Boo:** Successfully winning the Special Cup on Mirror Mode will unlock both Petey Piranha and King Boo as playable characters. They share a kart, the Piranha Pipes.\n\nAs you race, remember that Mirror Mode can be disorienting at first since all the tracks are reversed, so it might take some time to get used to the changes.

The mask will shimmer and produce a sound when there are stray fairies present.\n\n4. **Return All 15 Stray Fairies to the Fairy's Fountain**: Once you have collected all 15 stray fairies from the temple, you'll need to bring them to the Fairy Fountain in Ikana Canyon. The fountain is located in a cave near the entrance to the Stone Tower.\n\n5. **Receive the Great Fairy's Sword**: After returning the stray fairies, the Great Fairy of Kindness will thank you and reward you with the Great Fairy's Sword, the most powerful weapon in the game.\n\nThe Great Fairy's Sword is used as an item and not as a standard weapon, so you'll need to equip and use it from your inventory. It deals substantial damage and is effective against most enemies and bosses, making it a valuable asset for the remainder of your journey.","timestamp":"2025-07-16T23:43:17.853Z","username":"TestUser1"}],"userDoc":{"__v":0,"_id":"67b8d7eb60a9b6681114f29e","achievements":[{"_id":"684f2400386a706dbb66ba99","dateEarned":"2025-06-15T19:50:24.892Z","name":"Platformer Pro"}],"conversationCount":15,"email":"test@example.com","hasProAccess":true,"progress":{"actionAficionado":0,"adventureAddict":0,"battleRoyale":0,"beatEmUpBrawler":1,"bossBuster":0,"collectorPro":0,"conversationalist":0,"dailyExplorer":0,"dataDiver":0,"fightingFanatic":0,"firstQuestion":0,"frequentAsker":0,"horrorHero":0,"performanceTweaker":0,"platformerPro":1,"proAchievements":{"achievementHunter":0,"communityLeader":0,"expertAdvisor":0,"gameMaster":0,"genreSpecialist":0,"proContributor":0,"proStreak":0,"speedDemon":0},"puzzlePro":0,"racingRenegade":3,"rhythmMaster":0,"rpgEnthusiast":0,"sandboxBuilder":0,"shooterSpecialist":0,"simulationSpecialist":0,"speedrunner":0,"sportsChampion":0,"stealthExpert":0,"storySeeker":0,"strategySpecialist":0,"survivalSpecialist":0,"totalQuestions":4,"triviaMaster":0},"subscription":{"billingCycle":"monthly","cancelAtPeriodEnd":false,"currency":"usd","earlyAccessGranted":false,"status":"expired","transitionToPaid":false},"userId":"test-0tpl80ofp","username":"TestUser1"}}},"dbConnection":2963.94160000002,"finalMemory":{"external":"228.23MB","heapTotal":"259.59MB","heapUsed":"237.32MB","rss":"473.14MB"},"initialMemory":{"external":"220.83MB","heapTotal":"209.42MB","heapUsed":"191.7MB","rss":"410.84MB"},"questionProcessing":15451.196199999977,"requestRate":{"requestsPerSecond":"0.05","totalRequests":1},"responseSize":{"bytes":5338,"kilobytes":"5.21KB"},"totalTime":20173.95359999998},"questionLength":78,"service":"game-assistant","username":"TestUser1"}

To find it, you'll need to make your way to the Lockup area in the castle's dungeons. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get there:\n\n1. **Approach Hyrule Castle**: First, navigate to Hyrule Castle. You can enter from different paths, but an efficient approach is to start from the northwest side near the docks. This way, you can avoid some of the more heavily guarded areas.\n\n2. **Enter through the Docks**: Look for an area along the water where you can use Cryonis to create pathways over the water. From there, enter the docks and proceed inside the castle.\n\n3. **Make your way to the Lockup**: Once inside, your goal is to head downstairs towards the dungeons. Use your map to find the Lockup. Along the way, you'll encounter Bokoblins, Moblins, and possibly some Guardians, so be prepared for combat.\n\n4. **Locate the Stalnox**: In the Lockup area, you will face a mini-boss called a Stalnox. It is a skeletal version of a Hinox and serves as the guardian of the Hylian Shield. Defeat the Stalnox by targeting its eye with arrows, and when it falls, use melee attacks to deal damage.\n\n5. **Claim the Hylian Shield**: Once the Stalnox is defeated, a chest will appear. Open the chest to receive the Hylian Shield.\n\nThe Hylian Shield is one of the most durable shields in the game, offering excellent defense. It's worth noting that the shield can break after substantial use, but you can repurchase it from a special vendor named Granté in Tarrey Town after completing his side quest if it does break.
